# 🔭 Exoplanet Data Analysis: Exploratory Investigation
**Analyzing Planetary Properties and Habitability Patterns**

This project focuses on the systematic analysis of the NASA Exoplanet Archive to understand the physical relationships between planetary mass, radius, and host star characteristics. By leveraging Data Science techniques, the goal is to identify patterns in planetary composition and potential habitability.

## 🎯 Project Objectives
* **Data Cleaning & Wrangling:** Processing the NASA Confirmed Planets dataset, handling missing values, and optimizing data types.
* **Statistical Distribution:** Analyzing the frequency of planetary sizes (Radii) to identify the most common types of worlds in our galaxy.
* **Mass-Radius Relationship:** Visualizing the correlation between mass and radius to distinguish between terrestrial (rocky) and jovian (gas) planets.
* **Astroinformatics Pipeline:** Building a structured Python environment for astronomical data processing.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Tools
* **Language:** Python 3.13
* **Libraries:** * `Pandas`: Data manipulation and cleaning.
    * `NumPy`: Numerical calculations (Density/Gravity).
    * `Seaborn` & `Matplotlib`: Advanced astronomical visualizations.
* **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook / VS Code.

## 📊 Key Visualizations
Currently, the project features:
1.  **Mass vs. Radius Scatter Plot:** A logarithmic visualization showing the distribution of planetary populations.
2.  **Radius Distribution Histogram:** An analysis of how many "Earth-like" vs "Jupiter-like" planets exist in the current dataset.
